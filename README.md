## Important

```
ðŸ“¢ This project is old (2018)
TailwindCSS was a new thing back then. I was learning it and I wanted to try it in a real project. So, I made this game. I'm not proud of the code, but I'm proud of the idea. If you want to contribute, you're welcome. I'm not working on this project anymore.

## FAQ

Q: Is it the same as Geoguessr?

A: No, it's not. Geoguessr is a great game, but it's not free (5 rounds per day). Entiwin is free and it's based on Tunisia. Same concept, different game.

Q: Why did you make this game?

A: I wanted to learn TailwindCSS and I wanted to make a game. 

Q: How can I contribute?

A: You can contribute by adding new places to the game / fixing bugs / adding new features / updating to newer versions of Angular and TailwindCSS. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
